This project implements sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset using the pre-trained BERT model (bert-base-uncased). It fine-tunes the model for binary classification, where movie reviews are classified as either positive or negative. The project leverages Hugging Face's Transformers and Datasets libraries for model training and evaluation. The model is fine-tuned on the IMDB dataset with training parameters optimized for performance. After training, the model can be used to predict the sentiment of new movie reviews. The code is designed for easy setup and use on Google Colab, utilizing GPU acceleration for faster training and inference.
